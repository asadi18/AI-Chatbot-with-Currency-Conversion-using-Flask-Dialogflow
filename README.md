# 💬 AquaBasic – AI ChatBot with Currency Conversion

AquaBasic is a lightweight AI-powered chatbot built as a **practice project** using Flask, Dialogflow, and real-time API integration. It converts **USD and EUR to BDT** and handles **basic conversational chat** (like greetings, identity, help responses, etc.).

This project is designed to demonstrate how a simple chatbot can be deployed with end-to-end integration of NLP, REST APIs, and live web embedding — and it forms the foundation for more advanced AI/ML applications.
